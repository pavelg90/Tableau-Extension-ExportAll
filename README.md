# Tableau-Extension-ExportData

No matter how much you try to convince them, there will always be some users who want to reduce your beautiful Tableau charts to a table of numbers in Excel. So if they're going to do it anyway, you may as well give them a simple, controlled way, generating one Excel workbook and not a bunch of CSVs.

With the Export All extension for Tableau Server you can place a simple button onto your dashboard, choose which sheets & columns are exported, and with one click your users can download a clean & tidy Excel workbook.
